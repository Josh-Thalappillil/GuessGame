# GuessGame

I utilised my programming skills and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a guess game in C#. This project allowed me to practice encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction while creating a functional game. By dividing the project into smaller classes with specific responsibilities, I was able to write modular and maintainable code. Additionally, by using conditional statements, loops, and user input, I was able to make the game interactive and dynamic. This project helped me to solidify my understanding of programming fundamentals and object-oriented concepts, while also providing practical experience in developing a working application.
